Hi, folks! My name is Dr. C. Zachary Palmer, and I am a recently hooded, postdoctoral research fellow with both the Missouri University of Science and Technology (MS&T) and the University of Missouri (Mizzou). I received my Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss) in May 2025 under the advisement of Dr. Ryan C. Fortenberry. My <a href="/pdfs/diss.pdf">dissertation</a> work focuses on benchmarking emerging computational methodologies for to predict rovibrational spectral data for molecules of astrochemical and atmospheric importance.
