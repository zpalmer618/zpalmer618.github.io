Hi, folks! My name is Dr. C. Zachary Palmer, and I am a recently hooded, postdoctoral research fellow with both the Missouri Univserity of Science and Technology (S & T) and the University of Missouri (Mizzou). I received my Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss) in May 2025 under the advisement of Dr. Ryan C. Fortenberry. My [dissertation](/pdfs/diss.pdf) work focuses on the prediction of rovibrational spectral data for molecules of astrochemical and atmospheric importance.
